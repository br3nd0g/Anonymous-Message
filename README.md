# Anonymous Message Discord Bot

A discord bot with one slash command, that allows a user to write an anonymous message, addressed to another user in the server, and the bot then sends said message in a channel chosen by the user. It keeps it anonymous, as it sends the message seperate to the command, and replies to the user ephemerally.
